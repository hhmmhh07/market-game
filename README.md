# market-game
a simple super market game, designed to explore the impact of comparison on the market

## Abort
This project is a simple supermarket game, inspired by one of my college courses which aims to explore the impact of the comparison on the market. By simulating the supermarket system under different scenarios -- only one market, more than two markets but no communication, more than two markets with communication, it shows the different behaviours consumers will exhibit.

### game-rules

  * essentials foods
